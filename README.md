Write a program that will perform the following tasks, in turn
1. Randomly generates n integer numbers (to avoid duplicates, we want the range of the
data be much greater than the size of the data) and save them in an array data structure
2. Sort these numbers in order
3. Randomly generate m numbers, for each number, perform the following two search
algorithms on the array, record the actual search time (either target is found, or not).
3.1 linear search algorithm
3.2 binary search algorithm
4. create a report that has the following format
